Alyssa created the following code to keep track of items for a shopping cart application she's writing:

class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    # prevent negative quantities from being set
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end
Alan looked at the code and spotted a mistake. "This will fail when update_quantity is called", he says.

class InvoiceEntry
  attr_accessor :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    self.quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end

invoice = InvoiceEntry.new('shoes', 3)
puts invoice.quantity
puts invoice.product_name

puts invoice.update_quantity(5)
puts invoice.quantity
